## Functions

for adding two numbers like 2 and 3 we don't need to depand on struct we can call a function and add them.

1. It's is a general action like it performs a specific task and can be called from anywhere.
2. Independent on its own means it is not tied to any type (or) struct.
3. A function need all the data as parameters to execute.


## Methods
for real:
In a phone i want to take a photo to take a photo i need a phone first here phone is the struct.

1. a block of code tied to a struct.
2. method is nothing but a function with a special receiver argument.
3. A method already has some data inside it struct and uses it automatically.
